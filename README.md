# Flutter SQL Database Storage Using Sqlite & Sqflite CRUD

Flutter applications can utilize SQLite databases through the sqflite plugin available on pub.dev for local data persistence and querying.

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are implemented using SQL queries. For example, inserting data is done with row.insert(), while updating uses update() and deleting employs row.delete().
User interface components, such as dialogs and list views, are used to interact with the database, allowing users to add, delete, and update to-dos. These actions are facilitated through various methods and widgets implemented in the application.
